This was the first project created at the NOD bootcamp. The work was done in pairs, in order to work on collaboration in code, as well as sharing of ideas.

The time allocated for this project was tuesday after lunch up until thursday at 16:00. On the thursday, a presentation had to be created; this presentation can be found as a powerpoint in this repository.

Aim is to create a game using user-created interactive functions, and there were certain conditions that had to be met.
