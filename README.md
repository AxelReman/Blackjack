 Black jack game

 Pouria Momayyezi and Axel Reman developed this blackjack game during a two-day project at Nod coding bootcamp. The game simulates a casino blackjack game, with the player facing a computer simulated dealer. The game-logic follows the rules of professional blackjack dealers and accounts for all possible outcomes during a game of blackjack between one player and a dealer. The user can simulate casino blackjack gameplay within seconds and play an unlimited amount of times. With this game, users can experience the excitement of playing blackjack without leaving their home.
